# About

There are many sources of public information on politicians online. The issue is that an informed voter must comb through dozens of sources to get a full picture of a politician. This web app seeks to create automated summaries by aggregating data from trusted public APIs, including campaign finance, voting history, and public statements, into a single, interactive dashboard. The goal is to reduce research fatigue and help voters make informed decisions more efficiently.
